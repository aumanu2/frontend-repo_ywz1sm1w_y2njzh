        Urban Wheel Pottery is guided by a simple idea: bring calm, handcrafted beauty into everyday rituals. Each piece is thrown by hand in small batches, using sustainable practices and locally sourced clay. Our glazes are inspired by earth — terracotta, warm beige, clay brown, and muted olive — creating a palette that feels grounded and serene.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[var(--clay-700)] leading-relaxed">
        We believe in modern craftsmanship: minimal forms, tactile textures, and timeless utility. From the morning mug to a centerpiece vase, our work is made to be used and loved for years.
